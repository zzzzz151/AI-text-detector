# Abstract

TextSpotAI is our AI Text Detector as a Chrome browser extension.

Whenever you open a web page or PDF in your browser, it will evaluate for AI generated text in it.

It will display an overall evaluation, highlight parts of the text that it considers is probably AI generated, and you can also select any text and evaluate it.

It will have a thorough and intuitive UI that lets you select language models, set threshold probabilities for text highlighting, select which language models to use, and other settings.

Language model devs can also add their own language model to our AI through our Language Model Hub.
