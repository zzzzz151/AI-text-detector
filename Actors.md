**User**
Web users are our target audience: journalists, researchers, social media users, educators, students, developers, etc.
With our extension they will be able to, in regards to the currently opened web page or PDF file, get an overall evaluation (for instance, how much of it is AI generated text), check the probability that the currently selected text is AI generated, and have the suspicious parts of the page/PDF highlighted.
They can also upload their own language models and metrics to be used by our AI.
A less important feature is to allow the user to analyze any text he wants by inputting it (indenpendent of the current page/PDF).

**AI** 
Our AI is located in our server.
It will answer to the user's requests and needs as well as API requests.
It shall analyze any given text, url or html and return relevant output, such as probabilities of AI generated text, language models and metrics used, etc.
It can also learn a language model and accept/refuse language models. This acceptance/refusal can also be done manually by our dev team.
