**User**

Web users are our target audience: journalists, researchers, social media users, teachers, students, etc.

With our extension they will be able to, in regards to the currently opened web page or PDF file, get an overall evaluation (for instance, how much of it is AI generated text), check the probability that the currently selected text is AI generated, and have the suspicious parts of the page/PDF highlighted.

A less important feature is to allow the user to analyze any text he wants by inputting it (indenpendent of the current page/PDF).

**Admin** 

Admins (initially our team of 4) have maximum/all permissions.

They can accept, refuse, enable and disable language models, as well as metrics. This may also be done automatically by our AI.

**LM Developer**

Anyone with a LM can easily add their own language models and metrics to be used by our AI.
